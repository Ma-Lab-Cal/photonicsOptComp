# photonicsOptComp
Code and data for "Efficiency of machine learning optimizers and meta-optimization for nanophotonic inverse design"

There is a lot of data, and it's bigger than GitHub's 25Mb limit, so it can found in a google drive folder at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wVB8OOSr_QreLRktcmRb8Ci7DB2V3kpg?usp=sharing

Just extract the .zip folder and run the functions in photonicsOptCompFigureCreator.ipynb to generate the figures in the paper.

If you're interested in doing your own inverse design, download optSweepRelease.ipynb, alongside the jax (https://github.com/google/jax), fdtdz (https://github.com/spinsphotonics/fdtdz), pjz (https://github.com/spinsphotonics/pjz), optax (https://github.com/google-deepmind/optax), and jaxopt (https://github.com/google/jaxopt) packages, and follow the comments therein.
