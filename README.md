# photonicsOptComp
Code and data for "Efficiency of machine learning optimizers and meta-optimization for nanophotonic inverse design"

There is a lot of data, and it's bigger than GitHub's 25Mb limit, so it can found in a google drive folder at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wVB8OOSr_QreLRktcmRb8Ci7DB2V3kpg?usp=sharing

Just extract the .zip folder and run the functions in photonicsOptCompFigureCreator.ipynb to generate the figures in the paper
